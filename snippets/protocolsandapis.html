<h2 class="title"> What are Protocols and APIs? </h2>
<p>
    <b>Protocols</b> are the rules that define how data is transmitted across a network, 
    while <b>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</b> allow different software components to communicate with each other effectively. 
    Together, they form the backbone of communication in modern systems.

<h3 class="title"> Understanding the OSI Model</h3>
<p>The <b>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)</b>
    model is a conceptual framework that describes how data is transmitted and received over a network. 
    It consists of <b>seven layers</b>, each responsible for specific tasks that contribute to seamless communication:<br/></p>


<ol >
    <li><b>Physical Layer</b>:  Handles <b>physical connections</b> (e.g., cables, fiber optics). </li>
    <li><b>Data Link Layer</b>: Responsible for <b>Ethernet</b>, <b>MAC addresses</b>, and ensuring reliable data transfer over the physical link.  </li>
    <li><b>Network Layer</b>: Manages <b>IP addressing</b> and <b>routing</b>, enabling data packets to reach their destination across different networks.</li>
    <li><b>Transport Layer</b>: Manages <b>end-to-end connections</b> (e.g., <b>TCP</b> and <b>UDP</b>) and ensures reliable delivery of data. </li>
    <li><b>Session Layer</b> : Establishes and manages <b>sessions</b> between systems (e.g., <b>APIs</b>, <b>Sockets</b>).</li>
    <li><b>Presentation Layer</b> : Formats and encrypts data (e.g., <b>SSL</b>, <b>JSON</b>, <b>MPEG</b>).</li>
    <li><b>Application Layer</b> : Interfaces directly with the end-user applications, using protocols like <b>HTTP</b>, <b>FTP</b>, and <b>DNS</b>.</li>
     
</ol>

<br/>
<hr class="colored text-center">
<br/>

<h3 class="title">Overview of Common Internet Protocols</h3>
<ul >
    <li><b>HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</b>: The foundation of communication for the <b>web</b>, used to transfer content over the internet.</li>
    <li><b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</b>: Ensures <b>reliable, ordered, and error-checked</b> delivery of data packets.</li>
    <li><b>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</b>: A lightweight, connectionless protocol used for <b>low-latency</b> and <b>loss-tolerant</b> transmissions, ideal for video and gaming.</li>
    <li><b>WebSocket Protocol</b>: Provides a <b>persistent, full-duplex communication channel</b> over a single TCP connection, ideal for real-time applications.</li>
    <li><b>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</b>: The protocol for <b>sending email</b>.</li>
    <li><b>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</b>: Used to transfer files between hosts over TCP.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">API Architectural Styles and Examples</h3>
<p><b>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</b> are critical for enabling data exchange and communication.
    APIs come in different styles, each designed to serve a specific need and use case. </p>



<div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <div class="bg-warning"><b>REST (Representational State Transfer)</b></div>
            <p>
                REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from the client must contain all the information 
                needed for the server to understand and respond. REST is one of the most popular architectural styles for web services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Example:</b> Consider an online store where clients request information about products. REST APIs let customers get 
                product details, inventory levels, and prices using simple HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
                 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <div class=" bg-warning"><b>GraphQL</b></div>
        <p>
        GraphQL is an API style that provides clients with <b>precisely the data they need</b>, avoiding 
            over-fetching or under-fetching. It allows the client to specify the structure of the response, making it more flexible than REST.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example:</b> Imagine a mobile application that shows a user’s profile along with recent orders and recommendations. 
            GraphQL allows the app to request exactly what it needs in a single query, rather than making multiple REST calls.
        </p>
    </div>
         
 </div>

<div class="row"> 
  
    <div class="col-6">
        <div class=" bg-warning"><b>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) </b></div>
        <p>
        SOAP is a protocol-based architecture that provides a more <b>standardized</b> approach to building APIs,
            often used in enterprise applications where <b>security</b> and <b>transactional integrity</b> are paramount.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example:</b> Banking systems often use SOAP to ensure that transactions are securely processed with strict validation.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6">
            <div class="  bg-warning"><b>gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call)</b></div>
        <p>
             gRPC uses <b>Protocol Buffers</b> and is ideal for scenarios needing fast, compact, and efficient 
            communication, especially between microservices. It supports bi-directional streaming and is typically used for 
            low-latency, high-throughput communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example:</b>In a distributed system, services may need to talk to each other with minimal overhead. gRPC is used to 
            make quick calls between services that require consistent, real-time updates.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row"> 
    
      
        <div class="col-6">
            <div class="bg-warning"><b>Webhooks </b></div>
            <p>Webhooks are a lightweight way to enable one service to notify another when an event occurs. Unlike traditional 
                APIs that require constant polling, webhooks automatically push data to a specific URL when a predefined event takes place.
                 
            
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Example:</b> Webhooks are often used for <b>payment processing</b>—when a transaction is completed,
                 the payment gateway can send an update to the merchant’s server, triggering the next steps like order fulfillment.
                 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <div class="bg-warning"><b>Websockets </b></div>
            <p>
                WebSockets provide a <b>full-duplex communication channel</b> over a single, long-lived connection,
                 allowing real-time interaction between the client and server.
            
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Example:</b> WebSockets are commonly used in chat applications, live notifications, and collaborative platforms where real-time updates are critical.
            </p>
